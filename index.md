> The OWASP secureCodeBox Project is a **kubernetes based, modularized toolchain** for _continuous security scans of your software project_. Its goal is to _orchestrate_ and easily _automate_ a bunch of _security-testing tools_ out of the box. With secureCodeBox we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

## Description

The purpose of secureCodeBox is not to replace the penetration testers or make them obsolete. We strongly recommend to run extensive tests by experienced penetration testers on all your applications. For more information about this project, please have look at our [GitHub Repo secureCodeBox][scb-github] or [online documentation][scb-documentation].

Our _main goal_ is to implement a major security testing platform and framework which enables developers and teams to integrate a bunch of security testing tools in their CI/CD environment or kubernetes environment as easy as possible. The flexibility and scalability of the platform architecture leads to features like _multi tenancy support_, _large scale (multi-) project testing_, support of distributed and private networks, customisable security test flows, which enables projects to test complex environments without implementing the complete security testing infrastructure on their own.

Secondly we try to foster a broad range of security tools to be easily integrated. Also we will try to integrate existing OWASP Projects as building blocks in our platform.

### Architecture

![SCBv2 Architecture Overview](assets/images/scbv2-architecture.svg "SCBv2 Architecture Overview")

The secureCodeBox architecture is based on Kubernetes Custom Ressource Definitions (CRDs) and follows a function as a service (FaaS) principle. Therefore we implemented a Kubernetes operator which schedules _security scans_ as _kubernetes jobs_. This architecture is much more resource efficient. Instead of long running microservices (SCB v1 Architecture), scans only consume cluster resources for a short amount of time.  

## Roadmap

As of **Feb, 2021, the highest priorities for the next 12 months** are:

- Finalize a new kubernetes *autodiscovery* service which is capable of generating new secureCodeBox Scans based on existing or newly spawned kubernetes ressources.
- Finalize the deep integration with the OWASP DefectDojo Project, as a building block for security finding analytics
- Implement a  secureCodeBox UI to visualize the security scan findings as an alternative to OWASP DefectDojo and Kibana (ELK Stack)
- Integrate new Cloud specific security scanners for AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean

## Quickstart secureCodebox

### Deployment (based on Helm)
Deploy the secureCodeBox operator first:

```bash
# Add the secureCodeBox Helm Repo
helm repo add secureCodeBox https://charts.securecodebox.io

# Create a new namespace for the secureCodeBox Operator
kubectl create namespace securecodebox-system

# Install the Operator & CRD's
helm --namespace securecodebox-system upgrade --install securecodebox-operator secureCodeBox/operator
```

Optionally deploy SCB scanner charts for each security scanner you want to use. They should not be installed into the `securecodebox-system` like the operator so that different teams can use different kinds of scanners.
To get more informations about each scanner and hook please have a look at our [Documentation Website][scb-website-integrations] or the corresponding [GitHub Repo secureCodeBox][scb-github].

```bash
# The following chart will be installed in the `default` namespace by you can choose the namespace of your choice by
# adding `--namespace YOURNAMESPACE` to each line
helm upgrade --install amass secureCodeBox/amass
helm upgrade --install gitleaks secureCodeBox/gitleaks
helm upgrade --install kube-hunter secureCodeBox/kube-hunter
helm upgrade --install nikto secureCodeBox/nikto
helm upgrade --install nmap secureCodeBox/nmap
helm upgrade --install ssh-scan secureCodeBox/ssh_scan
helm upgrade --install sslyze secureCodeBox/sslyze
helm upgrade --install trivy secureCodeBox/trivy
helm upgrade --install wpscan secureCodeBox/wpscan
helm upgrade --install zap secureCodeBox/zap
```

Optional deploy some demo apps for scanning:

```bash
helm upgrade --install dummy-ssh securecodebox/dummy-ssh
helm upgrade --install bodgeit securecodebox/bodgeit
helm upgrade --install juice-shop securecodebox/juice-shop
helm upgrade --install old-wordpress securecodebox/old-wordpress
helm upgrade --install swagger-petstore securecodebox/swagger-petstore
```

Deploy secureCodeBox Hooks:

```bash
helm upgrade --install ufh securecodebox/update-field-hook
helm upgrade --install gwh securecodebox/generic-webhook
helm upgrade --install dssh secureCodeBox/declarative-subsequent-scans
```

Persistence provider Elasticsearch:

```bash
helm upgrade --install elkh securecodebox/persistence-elastic
helm upgrade --install dd secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo \
    --set="defectdojo.url=https://defectdojo-django.default.svc"
```
